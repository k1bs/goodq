# goodQ

goodQ is a small web app I made (currently sans styling) to play around with using ERB to build a Rails app. This was done as part of a class assignment. I experimented with custom routes, linked to custom controller methods.

At its core, goodQ is a very basic reddit clone.

Going forward, I will complete styling and implement mobile optimization.
